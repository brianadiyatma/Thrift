# Thrift Mobile

Thrift is an App Developed to provide a platform where people can sell their used stuff online. 

However this is not a full fledged app. I just learned how to code. Maybe there are some flaws here and there that I didnt catch. Its good to asume that this app is not ready for production. There are might be improvement in the future but Im not sure

to try out this project you need to have nodejs and expo installed on your system.

1. You need to install all of the dependencies
```
npm install
```
2. Start the app
```
npm start
```
3. Open it from your emulator by pressing 'A' or scan the QR Code from the expo client

Before you do all of that stuff you need to clone the server side code for this project and host it yourself.
